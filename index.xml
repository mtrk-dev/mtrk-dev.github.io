      <description>&amp;nbsp;Sequence Description Language &amp;nbsp; File Structure &amp;nbsp; mtrk files are UTF-8 encoded text-files in the JSON format and need to contain the following properties:
{ &#34;file&#34;: { // General information about the sequence and suited MR system }, &#34;settings&#34;: { // Settings relevant for the sequence execution }, &#34;infos&#34;: { // Parameters that are passed to IDEA (without impact on the sequence execution) // E.g., values that should be written into the DICOM tags }, &#34;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;Sample Sequence &amp;nbsp; The code below shows how the famous &amp;ldquo;MiniFLASH&amp;rdquo; sequence can be expressed using the mtrk SDL. In this formulation, the amplitude of the phase-encoding gradient is varied using an equation. Alternatively, the gradient amplitude could also be stored and read from an array using the line-counter as index.

      <description>&amp;nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions &amp;nbsp; Can I create mtrk files without generator?The mtrk format is human-readable and, therefore, it is possible to modify sequences by directly editing the file in a text editor. However, except for debugging tasks, it is generally easier to write a small program that generates the mtrk file (referred to as generator).How can I get help?Please use our Gitter Channel to get in touch (click the OPEN CHAT button on the bottom-right).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the mtrk website! We decided to put this page online already at this early stage to make the development as transparent as possible. However, please be aware that the project is still under active development and that the programming work has not been completed yet. We will announce on this website when a first stable release is available. In the meantime, feel free to follow or join our development work on Github.</description>

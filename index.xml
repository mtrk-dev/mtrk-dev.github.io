      <description>&amp;nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions &amp;nbsp; Can I create mtrk files without generator?The mtrk format is human-readable and, therefore, it is possible to modify sequences by directly editing the file in a text editor. However, except for debugging tasks, it is generally easier to write a small program that generates the mtrk file (referred to as generator).How can I get help?Please use our Gitter Channel to get in touch (click the OPEN CHAT button on the bottom-right).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the mtrk website! We decided to put this page online already at this early stage to make the development as transparent as possible. However, please be aware that the project is still under active development and that the programming work has not been completed yet. We will announce on this website when a first stable release is available. In the meantime, feel free to follow or join our development work on Github.</description>
